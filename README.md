# Conway's Game Of Life

#### A very naive implementation of Conway's Game of Life using ReactJS framework.

Contains a 20 x 30 grid where the user can select the pattern (after pressing the Reset button), and specify the Number of Timesteps and the Delay between each timestep. Implemented with wrap-around (e.g.- pattern from the bottom comes to top).
